#Write a Python program to determine the profiling of Python programs.
#Note: A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and 
#for how long various parts of the program executed. These statistics 
# can be formatted into reports via the pstats module

import cProfile

def cal():
    print(2+3+4)

cProfile.run('cal')

#this is used to profile functions meaning it shows how long the code takes to run to be able to uptimise
